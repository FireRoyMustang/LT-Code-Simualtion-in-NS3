The package includes the LT code module and test example.

file list:

/ltmodlue/  It is the module that includes encode and decode function. You should put it in /src/. For example, in my computer it's /home/bao/workspace/ns-3-allinone/ns-3.18/src/.
/Freshman2Davis240p.3gp It is a test source file.
/LTcodeUDPServerandClient.cc It is a file transfer demo using UDP plus LT code. You should put it into your scratch folder. For example, in my computer it's /home/bao/workspace/ns-3-allinone/ns-3.18/scratch/.
/FileTransferTCP.cc It tranfer the same file using TCP. The window size is recorded. You should put it into your scratch folder. 

Note, the LTcodeUDPServerandClient will try to decode the data several times before success as the received data increases.

\Enjoy our project!
